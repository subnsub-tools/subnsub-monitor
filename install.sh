# Paste the same token on every machine you want to watch — each one gets its
# own dashboard, told apart by a random id it creates on first run. To name
# one, add it after the token (or set MON_NAME):
#
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sh -s -- <TOKEN> --name "tokyo build box"
#
# The dashboard can also run commands on a machine, and that is OFF unless you
# ask for it right here — add --console, or turn it on later with
# `subnsub-monitor console on`. With it on, this machine runs what you type on
# the dashboard, as this user, and writes every command to its own log first.
# Those commands never pass through the relay: they come only through the
# end-to-end encrypted tunnel (see DIRECT MODE below), and only from a browser
# whose key this machine has pinned — the install line copied from your
# account's dashboard carries one.
#
# And it can update the helper for you, so a new release does not mean logging
# into every box. Also off by default: add --remote-update, or turn it on later
# with `subnsub-monitor update on`. --console implies it — a console can
# already run this installer. Nothing is downloaded until you press the button,
# and what gets installed comes from the release bucket and is checked against
# its published checksum, so the dashboard chooses only WHEN.
#
# Or let the helper press it: add --auto-update (or `subnsub-monitor autoupdate
# on` later) and it looks at the bucket once an hour and installs a newer
# release by itself. That switch counts only with remote updates on.
#
# Read-only host details — a top-process table on the card, and beside each
# five-minute bucket of the CPU history the names of the programs that used
# it — are always on where /proc shows other processes (Linux; Android as
# shell or root). Names only, no shell (go/inspect.go, prochist.go).
# --diagnostics is still accepted for compatibility and
# changes nothing.
#
# The dashboard can also SEARCH this machine's coding-agent sessions — a
# built-in part of the helper, nothing extra to install. The search runs over
# the console channel, so it reaches this machine only when --console is on;
# it reads the agents' own transcript files right where they are, and only
# matching snippets and the pages you open ever leave the machine.
#
# And it can keep them, so a machine that is asleep — or gone — still answers.
# That one is off unless you ask: add --sessions-sync, or turn it on later with
# `subnsub-monitor sessions sync on`. With it on, this machine parses its own
# transcripts, redacts them, and pushes the message text to YOUR account's
# archive over the same connection it already uses. It needs no console and
# implies none; it is the one switch here that sends something out rather than
# answering a question, which is why it has a switch of its own.
#
# DIRECT MODE — no account, no relay, no token. Add --direct and one or more
# --allow <nodekey:…> (the browser keys shown on the Monitor page), and the
# helper opens an end-to-end encrypted tunnel that the page reaches through
# a DERP relay — Tailscale's public tailcat relay unless you point it at your
# own with --derpmap <https URL>. Nothing about the machine is stored anywhere
# but here and in that browser; the page is a static display. Without a
# dashboard key pinned it is read-only: a command travels this tunnel only
# from a browser whose key the machine has pinned (MON_PUBKEY), which a
# --direct line alone does not do. A token may still be given beside it, in
# which case both run — and then this tunnel is the one road the console
# takes, since no command ever travels through the relay.
#
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sh -s -- --direct --allow nodekey:…
#
# The self-hosted page's line adds --pair <token>: a one-time identity that
# page made for this machine, so it can find the machine without anybody
# carrying its address back. The helper waits under that identity, for that
# one browser key, and hands it this machine's own address over the
# encrypted tunnel; then the pairing is deleted (and after a week regardless).
# The machine's own key and address are made here as always and never travel
# in a line. Until the pairing is done, treat the line like a password: whoever
# runs it first is the machine that page will show.
#

# count or temperature, all refused by the platform's own policy. This script
# stops on Android and says where to go instead, which is the Monitor page on
# a computer — it installs the helper on a phone over USB and starts it as the
# shell user, which reads all of it. A helper installed under Termux earlier
# keeps running, and --uninstall still removes it (it is handled before the
# platform is looked at).

# Uninstall:  sh install.sh --uninstall

# ----------------------------------------------------------- one per machine
# This installer is per HOME: it keeps everything under ~/.config and
# ~/.local/bin, and a re-run by the same user is a reinstall — the keeper is
# stopped first, the agent id is kept, the dashboard card stays the same. Run
# by a DIFFERENT user (a root shell, a sudo) it finds no manifest, installs a
# second copy, mints a second agent id and takes a second relay seat: two
# cards for one box, which is exactly what happened on 2026-09-14 (an install
# as `box` on the 1st, the same line pasted into a root shell on the 13th).
# So before anything is written, the other users' helpers are looked for —
# their processes, which is the one evidence any user can see: another
# user's ~/.config is 0700 — and a running one is a refusal that names the
# user, so the fix is "become that user", not "guess". --second (or
# MON_SECOND=1) is the deliberate way past it, for the person who really
# wants two accounts watching one machine.
#
# Both shapes the machine can be in are matched — the helper itself
# (`…/subnsub-monitor connect …`) and its keep-alive loop
# (`sh …/.config/subnsub-monitor/keeper.sh`), since the loop may be between
# restarts of the helper at the moment this runs. The loop is only a loop
# when a SHELL is running the file: `less` or an editor on keeper.sh is
# somebody reading it. On Linux the processes are read from /proc, argv by
# argv (NUL-separated, so a home with a space in it is one argument, and it
# works the same under busybox, whose ps has no -o). Elsewhere it is
# `ps axwwo` — the BSD spelling macOS and FreeBSD share, ww for the full
# command line — matched by the shape of the whole line rather than by
# splitting it on spaces. A kernel with hidepid, or no way to list processes
# at all, shows nothing here and the install goes ahead with a note: the
# guard is a courtesy against a slip of the hand, not a lock.

# daemon running in the system". It accepts daemon-reload, accepts enable
# --now, forks the process, writes a PID file, and exits 0. Nothing is left
# watching. `Restart=always` in the unit above is a line that program never
# reads, so the first time the helper exits for any reason — a crash, or the
# ordinary exit at the end of a self-update — it simply stays gone.
#
# What separates the real thing from a stand-in is runtime state a script
# cannot fake, because only PID 1 and a running user manager create it:
#
#   /run/systemd/system        exists only when systemd is PID 1
#   $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd   exists only when THIS user's manager is running
#
# Both, or this is not a systemd host, whatever /usr/bin/systemctl says. The

# No service manager here, so the helper gets one: a shell loop that starts it,

# This is not a systemd replacement and does not pretend to be. It is the

# restarts me if I die — on a box where nothing else will make it. Note what it
# is NOT for: since the helper re-execs itself in place after an update
# (go/restart.go), the loop does not even observe an update happening.
# The PID it is waiting on is the same PID, now running the new binary. What
# the loop is really here for is the crash.
#
# Two things are generated rather than assumed, and both were bugs first:
#
#   - The loop records its OWN pid, into a lock directory, at the moment it
#     starts. A PID file written by THIS script would be a lie after the first
#     reboot, because the @reboot line below starts the loop without this
#     script ever running — leaving a stale number that a later reinstall would
#     either kill something innocent with, or fail to stop the real loop with.
#   - Every path is single-quoted through shquote. $HOME and MON_BINDIR are not
#     character-restricted, and a path containing a quote or a $() would
#     otherwise be re-parsed as syntax by the very script being written.
