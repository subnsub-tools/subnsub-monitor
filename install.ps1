<#
subnsub-monitor installer for Windows.

  & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://tools.subnsub.com/monitor/install.ps1))) -Token <TOKEN>

Paste the same token on every machine you want to watch — each one gets its own
dashboard, told apart by a random id it creates on first run. To name one, add
-Name:

  … -Token <TOKEN> -Name "tokyo build box"

The dashboard can also run commands on a machine, and that is OFF unless you ask
for it right here — add -Console, or turn it on later with
`subnsub-monitor console on`. With it on, this machine runs what you type on the
dashboard, as this user, and writes every command to its own log first.

And it can update the helper for you, so a new release does not mean logging
into every box. Also off by default: add -RemoteUpdate, or turn it on later with
`subnsub-monitor update on`. -Console implies it — a console can already run this
installer. Nothing is downloaded until you press the button: there is no timer,
and what gets installed comes from the release bucket and is checked against its
published checksum, so the dashboard chooses only WHEN.

Source: https://github.com/subnsub-tools/subnsub-monitor (Apache-2.0)

…and if you would rather look first, which is the reasonable instinct for
anything that installs a background process:

  irm https://tools.subnsub.com/monitor/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
  notepad install.ps1
  .\install.ps1 -Token <TOKEN>

Installs a single binary to %USERPROFILE%\.local\bin and registers a scheduled
task that runs it at logon. No administrator rights, nothing written outside
your profile, no service and no driver.

Uninstall:  .\install.ps1 -Uninstall

WHY A SCHEDULED TASK AND NOT A SERVICE. A Windows service has to answer the
service control manager, which means either a second executable or a Go
dependency this project does not carry — and registering one needs
administrator rights that nothing else about this install needs. A task runs as
you, is visible in a tool everybody already has, and is removed by deleting it.
The cost is that it starts at logon rather than at boot; -RemoteUpdate and
-Console both work either way, and the note at the end says which trigger this
machine ended up with.
