"""subnsub-monitor — AI coding quota for machines you can't reach.

   Two providers, and they get their numbers in fundamentally different ways.

   CODEX — free of charge, no credential, no network. Codex writes the
   rate-limit envelope the server hands back into its own session logs:

     ~/.codex/sessions/<Y>/<M>/<D>/rollout-*.jsonl
       {"type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"token_count","rate_limits":{…}}}

   …so the numbers a menu-bar app shows are already sitting in a plain file.
   Reads go through _open_beneath, which walks down from a directory fd on
   SESSIONS_ROOT one component at a time, refusing a symlink at every hop and a
   hard link at the end. Two attacks motivate that machinery: a rollout-*.jsonl
   hard-linked onto auth.json is a genuine name inside the tree and defeats any
   path check, and swapping a PARENT directory for a symlink after the check
   defeats an O_NOFOLLOW that only guards the final component.

   CLAUDE CODE — costs a credential. Claude records no quota on disk at all
   (verified by walking every nested key in recent transcripts: token counts
   and a service_tier, nothing more), so the numbers must be asked for. This
   reads exactly one field out of ~/.claude/.credentials.json and calls the
   usage endpoint with it. See the section above collect_claude for the rules
   that come with holding a credential — chiefly that the same file also holds
   OAuth tokens for whatever third-party services the user has connected, and
   that this code has no business anywhere near those.

   THE LINE THAT STILL HOLDS: reading a credential is not shipping one. The
   token is used for one request and never logged, never cached, never sent
   anywhere — including via exception text, which is the sharp edge here: a
   token containing CR/LF makes the http layer raise an error whose message
   quotes the whole header, and this collector's failures are published. What
   does travel is quota numbers plus the plan and tier they belong to. So the
   claim is "no credential leaves the machine", not "only percentages leave".

   What none of this can do is constrain a malicious BUILD of this program —
   declining to use an ability is not the same as not having it. That takes an
   OS sandbox (landlock on Linux, sandbox_init on macOS), which the shipping
   binary should enter at startup. Everything above is a statement about this
   source, verifiable by reading it, not a guarantee about somebody else's
   binary.

   This is Python for the PoC — zero dependencies, runs anywhere python3 is.
   The shipping helper is meant to be a single static Go binary; the collection
   logic is deliberately written to port straight across (and Go should use
   openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH) where this walks by hand).

   Usage:
     ./monitor.py                        one snapshot as JSON, exit
     ./monitor.py --watch [SEC]          reprint every SEC seconds
     ./monitor.py --serve [PORT]         serve /quota + /events locally
     ./monitor.py --new-token            mint a relay token
     ./monitor.py --connect URL TOKEN    dial out and push to the relay
     ./monitor.py --selftest             show exactly which paths get opened

   --serve only ever shows you THIS machine. --connect is the real shape:
   outbound-only, so a browser anywhere can watch a box it has no route to.
