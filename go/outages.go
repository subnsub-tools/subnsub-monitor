// Outages — the stretches this machine was not running, kept HERE beside the
// history (history.go) and served over the tunnel with it.
//
// The trend archive shows an outage only as buckets that are not there, and
// the page draws a line straight across them: a fifteen-minute suspend on a
// VM looked like fifteen quiet minutes. Nothing else on the tunnel road can
// know better — the only party that saw the machine stop is the machine, and
// with no relay in the self-hosted shape there is nobody else to ask. So the
// helper keeps the record itself, in seconds rather than five-minute buckets,
// and the page reads it with the history.
//
// Two kinds, told apart by who was running:
//
//   suspend  the process was alive and its one-second ticker came back to a
//            wall clock that had moved much further than a second. A VM the
//            host paused, a laptop lid, a container frozen — the machine as a
//            whole stopped. (A clock stepped forward by NTP looks the same
//            from here and is recorded the same; a running machine's clock
//            does not step by half a minute.)
//   down     the process was not running: a stamp this helper writes once a
//            minute was older, at start, than the threshold plus the minute
//            the process may have run on after writing it. A reboot, a
//            crash, a stopped service. The stamp is a minute coarse, so a
//            `down` may read up to a minute longer than it was.
//   wipe     the same stale stamp, found by a process whose state directory
//            came from a DIFFERENT installation than the one it is running
//            on (hostid.go): the machine was wiped and rebuilt and its state
//            restored from a backup. Told apart from `down` because the two
//            mean different things to whoever reads the record — a reboot
//            keeps every file that was on the disk, a rebuild keeps nothing
//            but what somebody copied back (user 2026-09-26).
//
// Neither is "the network was away". The machine cannot tell that from
// here, and this file does not pretend to: a tunnel nobody could reach while
// the helper ran on is not an outage in this record.
//
// A third voice, louder than either heuristic: whoever put the machine back
// can SAY what happened. The stamp and the host id are inferences — good
// ones, but a rebuild that landed before the host id existed read as a
// reboot (box, 2026-09-26 05:17 CST), and the user wanted the record to be
// told, not guessed. So a restore service declares the outage:
//
//   declared-outage   a JSON object left in the state directory before the
//                     helper starts — {"kind":"wipe","by":"restore-service"} —
//                     read once at boot, consumed, and filed with the kind
//                     it names. `at` and `end` are optional; absent, the
//                     start is the stamp and the end is now, as for a down.
//   metrics.sock      the same object on the socket, for a helper already
//                     running: {"declare":{"kind":"wipe","at":…,"end":…}}.
//                     A row already covering that stretch is relabelled
//                     rather than doubled (custompush.go).
//
// Bounded like the history: a row count and an age, whichever bites first,
// written whole on each new row (rare), write-then-rename, 0600.
