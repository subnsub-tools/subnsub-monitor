// The machine's public IPv4 address, as a public "what is my IP" service
// answers it — and the country that service places the address in.
//
// THE ONE ADDRESS THE HELPER REPORTS FOR ITSELF. Everywhere else the egress
// on the card is an observation (transport.go, spaces.go): the address the
// relay saw a connection arrive from. That cannot answer two cases (operator
// ruling 2026-10-08: when the exit has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address,
// show the IPv4 first):
//
//   - A push that reaches the relay over IPv6 shows the IPv6 alone, however
//     much IPv4 the machine has. transport.go's IPv4-first dial covers an
//     ordinary dual-stack machine, but not one behind a platform proxy that
//     re-resolves every hostname and prefers AAAA (box, 2026-10-07: its pushes
//     arrive from 2a09:bac…, its IPv4-only destinations see 104.28.x).
//   - The self-hosted direct road has no relay at all, so nothing observes.
//
// So every half hour the helper asks a service over IPv4 — forced, even
// when the service has both records — and puts the answer in its reading as
// `public_ipv4`. The card's folded strip and Exit tile show it, on the hosted
// site and the self-hosted one alike; an address the relay saw a push arrive
// from is a line of the open card's Exit record, never the chip.
//
// The default service is Cloudflare's cdn-cgi/trace page, which answers with
// key=value lines: `ip=` is the address and `loc=` the country Cloudflare
// places it in. It is asked at the IP literal 1.1.1.1, not at a hostname:
// a machine behind a platform proxy that re-resolves every hostname itself
// and prefers AAAA (box) would otherwise reach a dual-stack name over IPv6
// whatever this dialer asks for, and the trace would answer with the IPv6
// the relay can already see — 2026.10.09.1 shipped with www.cloudflare.com
// and box lost its address and flag for an hour. A literal has no AAAA to
// prefer, and no fake DNS answer to be given either. The country rides beside the address as `public_cc`, and the
// flag the page draws on the chip is that country's: the same geolocation
// the hosted relay uses for the address IT sees, applied here to the address
// the chip actually shows — and the one flag a self-hosted dashboard, which
// has no relay to observe anything, can have at all (user 2026-10-09).
//
// MON_IPV4 picks the service: unset → 1.1.1.1, "off" → no lookup at all,
// an https URL → that one. A custom service may answer in the same key=value
// form (then its loc= is taken too) or with the bare address (no country, so
// no flag). Read from the environment first and then from the private config
// beside the token, where install.sh keeps what the install line said — so
// the service, which never sees the installing shell, does what that line
// asked.
