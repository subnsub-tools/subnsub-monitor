// The push response used to be discarded unread by every helper. It now
// carries one bit — `poll`: whether /commands is worth calling right now —
// and a machine that takes instructions reads it instead of asking on a
// timer. The reading it was going to send anyway is the request; this bit is
// the answer the cold poll existed to fetch. A relay computes it fresh on
// every push, so a hint lost with one response is re-sent by the next one,
// and the worst a wrong `true` costs is a single poll that finds nothing.
//
// PARSED ONLY on a machine with an instruction switch on (console, remote
// update or diagnostics). That line is load-bearing: a monitoring-only
// helper has never parsed a byte the relay produced, and it still does not —
// it also never polls, so the bit could tell it nothing. The set of machines
// that parse relay output stays exactly the set that collects work from it.
//
// A HINT, not an instruction. It selects between sleeps that both end in the
// same guarded poll; it cannot select work, name a command, or shorten the
// floor consoleWait already enforces. The worst a hostile relay can do with
// it is what it could already do by answering polls slowly.

	// ceiling, interval plus collection plus the request deadline can brush
