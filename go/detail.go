/* ── why a provider has no reading ────────────────────────────────────────
   A failed collector says the same thing twice.

   `detail` on the wire is an English sentence. Everything that reads a
   snapshot without a translation layer — raw JSON, the self-hosted dashboard,
   this helper's own console — needs a line a person can read, and picking one
   language for those is unavoidable.

   `detail_code` (plus at most one argument spliced into it) is that sentence in
   machine form. The panel has locales; handed a code it renders its own
   translation and never shows the English at all. Before the split the
   sentences were written in one language and printed verbatim underneath every
   other one, which is exactly the bug this exists to stop.

   The phrases below are the ONLY place the English is written — call sites
   pass a code, not prose. Two rules follow from a code being a wire value:

     - Keep the set closed and small. Every code costs a `mon.d…` entry in
       monitor.js and a string per locale in translations.js, and an unknown
       code drops the panel back to the English sentence.
     - Never rename one to mean something new. Old helpers keep sending the old
       code for as long as they run, and a rename that changes the meaning is a
       silent mistranslation rather than a missing string.

   detail_test.go fails the build if a code used in this package has no phrase
   here, or if a phrase here is used nowhere. */
