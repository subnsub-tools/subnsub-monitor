package main

// Codex, live.
//
// The account's rate limits as the Codex CLI itself sees them, asked over the
// app-server's stdio JSON-RPC:
//
//	codex app-server
//	  → {"id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"clientInfo":{…}}}
//	  → {"method":"initialized"}
//	  → {"id":2,"method":"account/rateLimits/read","params":null}
//	  ← {"id":2,"result":{"rateLimits":{…},"rateLimitsByLimitId":{…}}}
//
// Why this exists when codex.go already reads the number off the disk: the log
// holds only what a PERSISTED session recorded, and a machine whose Codex usage
// is all `codex exec --ephemeral` records nothing at all. One of ours reported
// 88% left for two weeks while the account was down to 19% — the reading was
// faithful to the file, and the file had stopped moving. A collector that can
// only be as fresh as your last interactive session is not a quota gauge.
//
// It also answers something the log cannot. `rateLimitsByLimitId` carries one
// bucket per metered limit — the account's own, and on this plan a separate
// weekly window for GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark. The logged envelope is a single flat
// snapshot with primary/secondary, so a second bucket has nowhere to go and
// simply never appears no matter how fresh the file is.
//
// Costs, measured rather than assumed: ~1.5s wall and ~90 MB peak RSS for the
// child, once per cache floor rather than once per push. It writes no session
// file and does not touch auth.json. Its rows in Codex's own log database are
// real but bounded — that database prunes on its own retention and was 99% free
// pages when this was written, so these land on space it already carries.
//
// What it gives up, which is the honest part: the log collector could say "no
// credential, no network". This one still holds no credential — it never opens
// auth.json — but it does ask the vendor's own tool to make a call on our
// behalf, exactly as amp.go does, and that tool may refresh the credential it
// owns while doing so. That is the `cli` rung, and the panel prints "via CLI"
// instead of "local log", so the difference is on screen rather than only in
// this comment.
//
// Upstream marks the app-server experimental, so this is a PREFERENCE and never
// a requirement. No binary, a protocol that moved, a machine that is signed out
// — every one of them falls through to the log scan, which is unchanged. The
// fallback is not decoration: on a box with no Codex binary in a place this is
// willing to run from, it is the only leg there is.

// `node` through PATH at exec time. Pinning an interpreter instead is not an

// keeping out a wrong one. What the fixed list actually guarantees is that the
// TOOL is the one the user installed; the interpreter is trusted exactly as far
// as this account's PATH is, which is the same footing every other CLI-rung
// collector here has always stood on.
//
// The node version managers are the difference from vendorCandidates' fixed
// list. Codex ships as an npm package, so on a great many machines it lives

// The fallback is deliberately silent about WHY it fell back, and that is not
// the same as hiding it. What the reader needs is which leg produced the number
// in front of them, and that is on the card already: `source` prints as "via
// CLI" or "local log", and a log reading that has stopped moving wears its own
// age next to it. A machine with no Codex installed would otherwise gain a
// permanent red error for a feature it never had.
//
// "Live wins" is a claim about FRESHNESS, so it has to be checked rather than
// assumed. The cache keeps serving its last success for a while after refreshes
// start failing (provhttp.go), which is right — a stale real number beats an
// error — but it means an `ok` reading here can be minutes old while a session
// written since then sits unread on disk. So a live answer that is no longer
// fresh is compared against the log rather than trusted on its rung alone, and
// whichever was recorded later is the one that goes out.
//
// Freshness is an AGE, and an age below zero is not a very small one. These are
// wall-clock seconds, so a machine that steps its clock backwards — ntp settling
// after a boot, a laptop returning from suspend, a VM resuming — produces a
// reading that appears to have been taken in the future. Reading that as "newer
// than new" would pin the live leg in place for as long as the jump lasted,
// which is exactly the interval when the log is the thing worth consulting. Only
// a plainly recent reading skips the comparison; everything else goes on to it.
//
// An unstamped live reading takes the same road for the same reason: unknown is
// not fresh. codexLiveFetch always stamps one, so that branch stands as the
// invariant holding rather than a case anyone expects to see.
