serve only ever shows you THIS machine. connect is the real shape:
outbound-only, so a browser anywhere can watch a box it has no route to.
The token may also come from SUBNSUB_MONITOR_TOKEN, or from the file the
installer wrote — both keep it out of ps and out of the task's arguments.

Every machine you paste the same token on gets its own dashboard, told apart
by a random id created on first run. Give it a name and the dashboard says
that instead; the name is yours to type and is never taken from the hostname.

console is OFF until you turn it on here, on this machine. With it on, the
dashboard can run a command as this user and show you the output; each command
is its own /bin/sh -c, so nothing persists between them, and every one of them
is written to this machine's own log before it runs. Turn it off with
'console off' and the helper stops asking the relay for work at all.

update is how a helper gets replaced without a shell here. The dashboard says
WHEN; what gets installed comes from the release bucket and is checked against
the published checksum, so the relay cannot point this machine at anything else.
Turning the console on implies it — a console can already run the installer —
and 'update on' is for a machine that wants the button and no console. Nothing
is downloaded until somebody presses it — unless 'autoupdate on' as well: then
this helper looks at the bucket once an hour and installs a newer release by
itself, the same way the button would. autoupdate counts only while update is
on; 'update off' switches the timer off with it.

trust is who may command this machine, as opposed to whether it takes commands
at all. The installer pins the dashboard's public key when you paste its line;
after that, 'trust <key>' adds another (a second browser, a colleague) and
'untrust' removes one. With at least one key pinned, a command must carry a
signature made by the matching private key — which lives in a browser and never
reaches the relay — so a relay can drop or delay a command but cannot write one.
With no key pinned this machine takes the closed-form commands the relay hands
it unsigned — update (if allowed), refresh, inspect, myip — and nothing else: a
shell line never arrives by the relay road at all, sealed lines and tunnel
commands are refused until a key is pinned. Both states are shown on the
dashboard, because they are not equally safe.

diagnostics is on wherever /proc shows other processes (Linux; Android as shell
or root) and is not a switch. It is read-only and independent of the console:
the dashboard may request a bounded top-process resource list, but receives no
command lines, environment, working directories or open files. The helper also
keeps the five busiest program names beside each five-minute bucket of this
machine's own history (30 days, in history.jsonl here), so the CPU chart can
say whose CPU it was. Names only, served over the direct tunnel to browsers you
allowed, never sent to the relay.

On Linux, a machine with other NAMED network namespaces (ip netns add — a VPN
exit on a router, say) gets each one's exit on its card as well: every five
minutes the helper makes one request to the relay from inside each namespace,
and the relay reports the address it saw. The helper itself never moves. It
needs the privilege to enter a namespace (root, in practice) and says nothing
about one it cannot enter. MON_NETNS=off turns it off; MON_NETNS=a,b limits it
to those names.

direct is the road with no relay on it: with it on, a browser holding this
machine's address reaches it through an end-to-end encrypted tunnel that
meets at a DERP relay (Tailscale's public one unless you point it at your own
with MON_DERPMAP), and nothing about this machine is stored anywhere but here
and in that browser. Off by default. Only browsers whose key you 'allow' get
in, the tunnel does not start while none is allowed, and being allowed is a
read-only view. Commands travel this road only from a browser whose key this
machine has pinned, under the same switches as the relay road; the console's
shell lines travel ONLY this road. It runs
beside the relay push when there is a token and alone when there is not;
MON_TRANSPORT=relay or =tailcat forces one or the other.

A portable copy is a dashboard's access lent to a command line for a while
(the Monitor page: a machine's terminal → Create a copy). On the computer that
should have it: 'clone use' keeps the copied line, 'run <machine> -- <command>'
runs one console line there and returns its output and exit status, 'shell
<machine>' opens a terminal, 'clone' says what it covers and until when, and
'clone forget' deletes it. A copy reaches machines over tailcat, as the
dashboard's console does, signed with keys of its own; each machine admits it
for console lines and terminals only, and refuses it once it expires. On a
machine, 'clones' lists the copies it admits and 'clones revoke <id>' ends one.

transfer is ON by default once direct is: a browser this machine allows may
invite one other browser, for one file transfer, to meet it here when the two
cannot reach each other — the Transfer tool's last resort. The machine
couples the two streams and forwards bytes it cannot read (they are encrypted
between the browsers); the guest is admitted for that session only and can
reach nothing but the pipe. 'transfer off' refuses new invites at once.

sessions sync is OFF until you turn it on here, and it is the one switch that
sends something OUT rather than answering a question: with it on, this machine's
agent conversations are parsed, redacted and pushed to your account's archive,
where the dashboard can search and read them while this machine is asleep or
gone. It is independent of the console — neither implies the other — and only
the message text travels: no transcript file, no paths, no tool plumbing.
