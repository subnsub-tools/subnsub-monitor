// This used to be a bare os.Exit(0) with a comment naming the three service
// managers that would start the successor: systemd's Restart=always, launchd's
// KeepAlive, the Windows task's repetition trigger. That comment described an
// assumption rather than a guarantee, and the assumption fails in a whole
// class of environment this helper is meant for — a machine you cannot reach,
// which is exactly where nobody notices it did not come back.
//
// The environment that proved it: a container whose PID 1 is `tini --
// /pod-daemon`, no /run/systemd/system, no /run/user/$UID, and
// docker-systemctl-replacement (a Python script whose own docstring says "run
// 'systemctl start' ... without a systemd daemon running in the system")
// installed at /usr/bin/systemctl. install.sh asked `command -v systemctl`,
// got yes, wrote a unit with Restart=always and reported success. The shim
// forked the helper and wrote a PID file. Nothing was watching it. The helper
// updated itself, exited as designed, and the machine went quiet for seven
// hours holding a relay seat.
//
// So on Unix the restart stops being someone else's job. See restart_unix.go
// for how, and restart_windows.go for why Windows deliberately keeps the old
// arrangement.
