package main

// The console — commands typed on the dashboard, run on this machine.
//
// This is the one part of the helper that DOES something to the box rather
// than reading it, so the whole design is about who decides that it may.
//
// OFF UNLESS THE OPERATOR TURNED IT ON, AT THE MACHINE. Not a checkbox on a
// web page, not a flag the relay can set, not a default anyone can be talked
// into: a file in this install's own config directory, written by someone who
// had a shell here already. `consoleEnabled` is the only thing consulted, it
// fails closed on every error, and a helper with the file absent never asks
// the relay whether there is anything to run — so there is no channel to
// attack, not merely no permission to use one. Every install in the field
// today is in exactly that state and stays there until its operator says
// otherwise.
//
// A SHELL LINE ARRIVES ONLY THROUGH THE TUNNEL (direct.go): end-to-end
// encrypted between the dashboard's browser and this machine, from a browser
// whose key is on the allow list, signed by one this machine has pinned. The
// relay's mailbox, which consoleLoop below still polls, carries only the
// closed kinds — update, refresh, rename, allow, inspect, act, myip — and a shell line
// handed over by it is refused, not run (operator ruling 2026-10-06: no
// console work at all without a tailcat connection, and a command never
// travels by way of the relay). Both roads are outbound
// from here — the tunnel is a dial to a DERP relay, the mailbox a poll — so
// nothing listens on this machine either way, a machine behind NAT works
// unchanged, and unplugging the console is still deleting a file.
//
// What runs is `/bin/sh -c <line>` — `cmd.exe /s /c <line>` on Windows; see
// console_unix.go and console_windows.go — as the user the helper runs as, in
// that user's home directory. It is not a shell session: each command is its
// own process with its own environment, so `cd` does not persist and neither
// does anything else. A real session is the terminal (pty.go), the console's
// other door, on the same tunnel and behind the same switch.
//
// THE SHELL IS THE PLATFORM'S OWN, and nothing above this line translates
// between them. A machine running Windows answers `dir` and not `ls`, which is
// the honest arrangement: the alternative is a helper that quietly rewrites
// what somebody typed, and there is no version of that which does not
// eventually run something other than what was asked for.
//
// Every command is written to stderr before it runs. On a normal install that
// is the systemd journal, the launchd log, or the scheduled task's own output,
// which means the machine keeps its own record of what was done to it that does
// not pass through us.
