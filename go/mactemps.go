// The half of the macOS temperature reading that is not macOS: what a sensor
// is called, how its bytes become degrees, and what the parent believes of
// what the child printed. No build tag, for the reason macstats.go gives —
// this is tested everywhere, and the only part that cannot be is the part
// that calls into IOKit (temps_darwin.go).
//
// WHERE THE READINGS COME FROM. An Intel Mac keeps its sensors in the SMC,
// under four-character keys that begin with T ("TC0P"); each is asked for by
// name and answers in a fixed-point format. An Apple Silicon Mac publishes
// them as HID services with a product name ("PMU tdie1") and a temperature
// event. Neither has a command-line tool that prints them without root, and
// both are reached through IOKit — which this build, being CGO_ENABLED=0,
// calls through purego.
//
// WHY A CHILD PROCESS. Those are calls into somebody else's library through
// pointers this program computed, and a mistake in one is a segfault that no
// recover() sees. So the helper does not make them: it runs itself as
// `subnsub-monitor temps`, which makes them, prints rows, and exits — and a
// child that crashes, hangs or prints nonsense costs the temperature tiles and
// nothing else. The parent reads the output the way it reads vm_stat's.
