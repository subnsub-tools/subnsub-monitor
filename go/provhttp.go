// Shared plumbing for the credential-holding collectors (Claude was the first;
// Copilot and Kimi joined it). Two pieces live here, and both
// exist because the fourth copy of either would have drifted from the third:
//
// THE CACHE FLOOR. Every one of these is a real request to someone else's
// service, and the push loop's 30s would be 2,880 calls a day per machine per
// provider. The rules are amp.go's, which found them the hard way:
//   - the floor is on ATTEMPTS, not successes, so an outage does not turn the
//     floor off exactly when hammering helps least;
//   - inside the floor a stale-but-real reading is served over a fresh error,
//     up to a staleness bound past which the error is the truth;
//   - CapturedAt says when we looked, RecordedAt when it was fetched, so a
//     cached reading visibly ages on the page.
//
// THE REQUEST SHAPE. Same non-negotiables as claude.go, because these carry
// credentials: redirects refused outright (Go's client forwards Authorization
// on same-host hops — a redirect anywhere is a token handed to whoever named
// the Location), bounded reads, and NO error text derived from the transport —
// an http error can quote the URL and the Authorization header, and these
// failures are PUBLISHED.
