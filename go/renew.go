// Keeping the relay token alive without ever holding a permanent secret.
//
// The token this helper pushes with expires. That is deliberate — it is a
// self-contained statement that an account was entitled to the relay when it
// was issued, and a statement nobody can revoke had better stop being true on
// its own. But the installer writes one token and walks away, so without
// something here every machine an account owns goes dark on the same day, and
// the dashboard reports it as "these machines stopped reporting" when the
// machines are fine.
//
// So: shortly before it expires, trade the current token for a fresh one. The
// site re-checks the subscription while doing it, which is the part that makes
// this more than a workaround — today a cancelled subscription keeps working
// until the token runs out because nobody ever looks again.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY IS NOT. It is not a channel. The response is one
// string, and it is accepted only if it is the SAME ACCOUNT, expires later than
// what we hold, and does not claim an absurd lifetime. Nothing here can be told
// to change an interval, run a command, or fetch anything — the helper's habit
// of not parsing what the network says is worth keeping, and the way to keep it
// while still renewing is to make the one parsed value a token and nothing else.
//
// And it does not talk to the relay. The relay has no database and no idea who
// anyone is; entitlement lives on the site that issued the token in the first
// place. Renewing there keeps the relay a stateless verifier that never learns
// an identity, and keeps push responses unparsed — see transport.go.
//
// ⚠ THE TOKEN IS A BEARER SECRET AND IT BELONGS TO ONE RELAY. This file will
// not send it anywhere the operator did not point it. Renewal is OFF unless the
// relay is the one this build ships with, or the operator named a renewal site
// themselves — see renewalSite(). A helper aimed at somebody's own relay must
// never hand that relay's credential to ours because our relay happened to
// answer 403.
