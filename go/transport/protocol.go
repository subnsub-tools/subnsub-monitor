// Package transport is the helper's carrier-neutral wire layer: the versioned
// frame every carrier moves, the interface a carrier satisfies, and the two
// carriers that exist today — the tailcat tunnel (tailcat.go) and an in-memory
// fake for tests (fake.go).
//
// The HTTP relay is deliberately NOT ported into this package yet. Its push
// loop (transport.go in package main) is entangled with token renewal, the
// console mailbox and the archive sync in ways that a mechanical move would
// only obscure; the plan's Phase 1 asks for that loop to keep behaving exactly
// as it does today, and the honest way to satisfy "unchanged" is to leave it
// unchanged and make the NEW carrier speak this protocol from day one. When
// the relay is migrated, it becomes a third file here and nothing above it
// needs to learn a new shape.
//
// What every carrier promises, whichever bytes it moves:
//
//   - a Frame is versioned, and a reader that does not know a frame's type
//     refuses it rather than guessing — a helper from months ago must never
//     execute a frame type invented after it shipped (plan invariant 3);
//   - a frame has a byte ceiling that is checked BEFORE the body is decoded,
//     so a hostile peer cannot make the reader allocate first and think later;
//   - a frame carries the agent id it is about and a correlation id, so a
//     reply can be matched to its request across any carrier.
