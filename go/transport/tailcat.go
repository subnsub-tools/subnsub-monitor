// The tailcat carrier: a WireGuard tunnel with DERP as the rendezvous and
// relay of last resort, no Tailscale account or control plane involved
// (github.com/tailscale/tailcat, BSD-3-Clause — see helper/NOTICE).
//
// Shape, and why it is a SERVER here even though the helper's whole design
// is "nothing listens": the tunnel's listening side opens no TCP port on
// this machine. It dials OUT to a DERP relay and waits there, exactly as the
// relay push dials out to monitor.subnsub.com. A browser holding this
// machine's address dials the same relay, the two sides meet, and from then
// on the bytes are end-to-end encrypted between them — the relay sees
// ciphertext, and so does anyone running it. What the machine exposes is
// one TCP port INSIDE that tunnel, served by an http.Handler the caller
// supplies, and only to clients whose node key is on the allowlist.
//
// UDP first, DERP when it must (operator ruling 2026-10-16: it is UDP first by nature,
// and TCP only when it has no choice but DERP). magicsock binds one UDP socket on an
// ephemeral port and tries a direct path to every peer that can take one;
// DERP — always TCP, TLS on 443 — carries whatever no direct path forms
// for. Every browser is such a peer (a browser has no UDP), so browsers
// stay on DERP; a native peer (another tailcat, a future app) goes direct.
// What reaches a handler through that socket is still only WireGuard from
// an admitted key: the allowlist gates it exactly as it gates DERP.
//
// THE PRICE, stated so nobody rediscovers it as a bug: the moment a peer's
// handshake completes, tailcat sends it a disco CallMeMaybe naming every UDP
// endpoint this machine knows — the STUN-learned public ip:port and the
// addresses of its interfaces — sealed to that peer's key, so the peer can
// read them. That is how a direct path forms at all, and upstream has no
// per-peer filter. Watchers are the machine's owner; a transfer guest
// (pipe.go) is whoever the owner's browser was sending a file to, and it
// learns them too. From 2026-09-05 until this ruling the carrier was pinned
// to DERP (TS_DEBUG_ALWAYS_USE_DERP + TS_DEBUG_OMIT_LOCAL_ADDRS) to keep
// exactly that away from guests, at the cost of never going direct.
//
// Three boundaries the plan draws, and where each is enforced:
//
//   - WireGuard-level admission (Server.AllowedClients): a key not on the
//     list is silently ignored at the handshake — it cannot even learn that
//     the server exists. Set at Start and grown at runtime by AddAllowed.
//   - Application-level admission (Gate): every HTTP request is mapped back
//     to the node key that sent it and checked against the CURRENT list, the
//     one the caller re-reads from disk. This is the online revocation point:
//     the upstream library can add an allowed client but cannot remove one
//     (helper/tailcat-lab findings, 2026-08-31), so a key struck from the
//     file stops being served here, on its next request, without a restart.
//   - Capability (the handler): being admitted grants OBSERVE and nothing
//     else. Console, update, sessions and archive do not exist on this
//     carrier in this generation, so there is no frame a tunnel peer can
//     send that runs anything (plan invariant 3).
