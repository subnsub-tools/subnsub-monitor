/* ── who is allowed to give this machine orders ────────────────────────────

   The console, the update button and the diagnostics drawer all arrive the
   same way: this helper polls a relay, and the relay hands it a command. The
   local switches decide WHETHER this machine takes instruction at all. They do
   not decide FROM WHOM — and until this file existed, the honest answer to
   "who can run a command here" was "whoever controls the relay", because a
   command carries no evidence of who wrote it and the helper had none to
   check. That is a protocol boundary, not a bug in anybody's server, and no
   amount of care on the relay side can close it.

   So a command can now carry a signature, and this is where it is checked.
   The private key lives in the dashboard's browser and is never sent
   anywhere; the PUBLIC key is pinned on this machine at install time and can
   be extended at the keyboard afterwards. A relay is then a courier: it can
   drop a command, delay it, or hand back an old one — availability was always
   its to withhold — but it cannot compose one, because it never holds the key
   that would make a command acceptable here.

   Two rules that shape everything below:

     - Pinning is the switch. With no trusted key on the machine, nothing
       changes: this helper behaves exactly as it did, because every existing
       install would otherwise stop taking commands the moment it updated. With
       one or more pinned, an unsigned or badly signed command is REFUSED, and
       refused out loud so the dashboard can say why.
     - Verifying the signature is not enough by itself. A signature is valid
       forever, so a relay could keep a command somebody legitimately sent and
       replay it later — at a worse moment, or a hundred times. Freshness and
       single-use are enforced here too, and they are what make this a control
       rather than a decoration. */

// over (target: "\ncd /safe", cmd: "rm -rf *") — and `sh` ignores target, so a

── single use ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

	Held in memory rather than on disk. A restart forgets, which sounds like a
	hole and is bounded by the freshness window: a replayed command has to be
	under five minutes old to be considered at all, so the exposure is a restart
	inside that window rather than "forever". Writing every command id to disk
	would put a write on the path of every keystroke in the console, for a
	window this narrow.

	Forgetting is by AGE, never by count. An id has to be remembered exactly as
	long as a command carrying it could still be accepted — issuedAt plus the
	skew — and no longer. Dropping the oldest to make room, which is what this
	did first, quietly breaks that: hand a busy machine enough commands and the
	one you want to replay falls out of the set while its signature is still
	fresh, which is the entire attack this set exists to stop.
